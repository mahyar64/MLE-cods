# Machine_learning_Engine_for_android
This application is a context-aware machine learning engine for wearable devices. By applying time,
location and user actions for mobile settings as inputs of system, wearable device will be able to 
recognize the environment and adjust appropriate mobile settings for that environment. We used 
Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) library. This library is written in C/C++,
to be able to use it in android mobile platform, we have to use NDK (Native Development Kit) 
to be embedded in android SDK platform. This Machine Learning Engine is extensible to be more general.
Android propose Java Native Interface (jni) framework is used in this project that enables Java code running 
in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications such as c and C++. 

#Implementation platform:
This project has been implemented on both Android Studio 2.3.3 and Eclipse. However this files have been 
imported from android studio. My recomandation is to use Android studio to implement the project.
